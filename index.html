            <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
            <p>The West Chester Food Cupboard was born in 2009 when the old food cupboard, run for many years by Chester County Cares, closed. Dismayed volunteers banded together and decided to step up to the challenge and run a new food cupboard themselves and so the adventure began. In 2012 they had been sufficiently successful to form their own non-profit 501©(3) organization.</p>
